# Supervised Machine Learning 

## Challenge 
### Background 
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as the number of good loans easily outnumber the number of risky loans. Therefore, weâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Our client asks you to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. Our final task is to evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

### Objective
- Implement machine learning models.
- Use resampling to attempt to address class imbalance.
- Evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

### Summary of Analysis 
#### Oversampling with RandomOverSampler

#### Oversampling with SMOTE algorithms

#### Undersampling with cluster centroids algorithm

#### Combination approach with the SMOTEENN algorithm

#### Prediction with BalancedRandomForestClassifier
