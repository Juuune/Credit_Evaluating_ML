# Supervised Machine Learning 

## Challenge 
### Background 
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as the number of good loans easily outnumber the number of risky loans. Therefore, weâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Our client asks you to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. Our final task is to evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

### Objective
- Implement machine learning models.
- Use resampling to attempt to address class imbalance.
- Evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

### Summary of Analysis 
| Model | precision | recall | Accuracy score |
| :------  | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Naive Random Oversampling | high-risk : 0.01 <br\> low-risk : 0.99 | high-risk : 0.67 <br\> low-risk : 0.63 | 0.648 | 
| SMOTE Oversampling | high-risk : 0.01 <br\> low-risk : 1.0 | high-risk : 0.62 <br\> low-risk : 0.68 | 0.649 | 
| ClusterCentroids Undersampling | high-risk : 0.01 <br\> low-risk : 1.0 | high-risk : 0.63 <br\> low-risk : 0.42 | 0.523 |
| SMOTEENN algorithm | high-risk : 0.01 <br\> low-risk : 1.0 | high-risk : 0.72 <br\> low-risk : 0.59 | 0.658 | 
| Balanced Random Forest Classifier | high-risk : 0.03 <br\> low-risk : 1.0 | high-risk : 0.61 <br\> low-risk : 0.88 | 0.745 | 
| Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier | high-risk : 0.04 <br\> low-risk : 1.0 | high-risk : 0.88 <br\> low-risk : 0.88 | 0.881 |

- According to precision and recall scores, the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier performed better compare to 5 models we used to predict credit risk. However recall score of high-risk loan is 0.04, to predict high-risk loans we might need to research for a better prediction algorithm.
